            <h3><em>Pro bono</em> science</h3>
            <p>Our members are doctoral students, PhD-holding research scientists, and professors who donate their skilled labor and expertise to our partner organizations. We can help formulate questions that can be answered with data, analyze pre-existing data, and figure out how to act on the results. We can also serve as guides to particular domains of scientific knowledge.</p>

                        <p>Currently, New York State and North Carolina are the only two states that prosecute all 16- and 17-year-olds as adults, incarcerating them in adult jails and prisons, severely affecting their re-entry, rehabilitation, and social development. Raise the Age NY is a campaign that supports a comprehensive approach to raising the age of criminal responsibility in New York State.</p>
                        <p>At ScAAN, we are compiling scientific evidence for Raise the Age NY that suggests lasting negative effects caused by the social stress and trauma of adult detention centers. Furthermore, juveniles are particularly responsive to rehabilitation and habit reformation through means other than adult detention centers. We are also working with Raise the Age NY to produce infographics appropriate for public communications.</p>
